# weather-app

Live Preview: https://miken29.github.io/weather-app/

Outcomes:

- This is a Weather App which takes a users input location and displays current and future forecast.
- Pulls data from an API
- I am appy with the outcome however I think my code is WET!
- I think as a learning point to develop this project I would like to refactor my code and get rid of where I am repeating myself. Some good things to work on!
